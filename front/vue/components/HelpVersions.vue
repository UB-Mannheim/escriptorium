    Each line corresponds to an edition of the content, in inverse chronological order (Most recent at the top).
    <br>The colors represent the difference with the previous version,
    <br><font color="green">green</font> are <b>additions</b> while <font color="red">red</font> are <b>deletions</b>,
    <br>meaning red characters are not actually part of the line anymore, they are displayed to easily spot the differences.
    <br>You can mouse over the text to see the actual content.
    <br>The load state button <i class="fas fa-file-upload"></i> simply revert the content of the line to the corresponding text version.
